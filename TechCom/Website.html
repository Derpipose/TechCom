        <p><strong>What are TTPRGs</strong></p>
        <p>
            Table-Top Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) are collaborative storytelling games. One player, called the Game Master (GM), sets up the story and leads the various interactions. The other players create characters that exist in the world of the story.
            TTRPGs can take place in a variety of settings and genres, from high fantasy, to science fiction, to horror, and more. Characters interact with the story using their characters, making choices, and rolling dice to determine the outcome of various interactions. On the whole, the goal is to tell a story with a group of people. What that story is, you must discover yourself.

                <p><strong>The DM</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The GM is central to every TTRPG. They are the narrator for the story, and are in charge of managing the world in response to the player’s actions. The GM is in charge of setting up what the players are going to do, and what needs to be done to do it. The GM has the final say as to the outcome of every action, and the consequences of the actions. The GM is also in charge of every rule, and any attempts at homebrew must be accepted by them.

                <p><strong>The Dice</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Dice are an inherent part of any TTRPG. They are commonly used for what are called ‘skill checks’. You roll a die, and depending on the number rolled, that skill succeeds or fails, to varying degrees. The most common die is called a ‘D20’, short for a 20-sided die. However, other dice are used for other game actions, depending on the game. For instance, in Dungeons and Dragons, D4’s, D6’s, and D10’s are all used for various attacks.

                <p>
                    With the exception of the GM, every player in a TTRPG has a character. Every TTRPG has their own way of making characters, and you can find premade characters online if you’d prefer. Depending on the game, you may be able to choose the species, or ‘race’, of the character, or you may simply be humans. You will determine your abilities either by rolling dice, using a ‘point buy’ system, or some other method described by the TTRPG. Your personality is a lot more subjective. You may ignore this and focus everything on the numbers, but it is often more enjoyable to give your character a personality. It can be based on fictional characters, yourself, or an original character of your own design.
